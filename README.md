# alpine-firestore-backup

Image that performs Firestore backups based on `google/cloud-sdk:alpine` image.

# Why this image

We use a lot of Firebase features like Firestore.
But there is no simple way to backup the data.
This image aims to be used inside the Google Cloud Platform to perform backups automatically.

# 2 ways to backup your Firestore data

## Use the public image

You can use the public `gcr` image available on `gcr.io/zenika-hub/alpine-firestore-backup`

## Create your own image

You can also create your own image from the repository to be independant. But you have to maintain the update of your image by yourself.

To do this, clone this repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/jlandure/alpine-firestore-backup.git
```

Build:

```sh
docker image build -t gcr.io/[GCLOUD_PROJECT_NAME]/alpine-firestore-backup
```

Push:

```sh
gcloud auth configure-docker
gcloud push gcr.io/[GCLOUD_PROJECT_NAME]/alpine-firestore-backup
```

# Create a bucket on GCP

Create a [GCP coldline bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes) and save the name of your bucket.

# Create a service account

Create a [GCP Service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-accounts) with the following rights:

- `Owner`
- `Cloud Datastore Owner`
- `Cloud Datastore Import Export Admin`
- `Storage Admin`

Then, download the [JSON private key file](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys).

# Create your env variables for Cloud Run

Please fill in the following information:

- `GCLOUD_PROJECT_NAME`
- `GCLOUD_BUCKET_NAME`
- `GCLOUD_SERVICE_KEY`

For the `GCLOUD_SERVICE_KEY`, make a base64 encoded string using this command:

```sh
cat key.json | base64
```

# Set up Cloud Run

Create a `Cloud Run service` using the public image `gcr.io/zenika-hub/alpine-firestore-backup` or your own image `gcr.io/[GCLOUD_PROJECT_NAME]/alpine-firestore-backup`.

Be careful to:

- Choose your newly image in `latest`
- Choose "Cloud Run (fully managed)" and a location
- Enter a service name
- Select "Allow unauthenticated invocations"
- In the "Show optional settings / Environment variables", set the 3 environment variables seen in the previous section

You can test the service using your browser: `https://alpine-firestore-backup-XXX-run.app/`

Save the url created to call your Cloud Run Service.
For example: `https://alpine-firestore-backup-XXX-run.app/backup`

# Launch with Cloud Scheduler

Prepare a `Cloud Scheduler` to send a request to your `Cloud Run Service` every time you need.

For example, every Monday at 3:00am `0 3 * * 1`

# Monitor the backup operations

You can also check the current status of each backup operation using the following url `https://alpine-firestore-backup-XXX-run.app/list`
